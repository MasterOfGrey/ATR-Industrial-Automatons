*Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2921585989]Mid-saver Saver[/url] to add safely due to the changes to certain biomimetic defs which may cause issues in some saves.
*You can attempt to clean your save and remove with Mid-saver Saver but it is strongly not recommended.

This mod reworks and expands upon features designed to be used or best operated with T1 and other biomimetic drones.
The most efficient way to produce the things in this mod is definitely by either using biomimetic drones, or having lots of grunt workers on hand.

[h1]Features:[/h1]
[b]Complete re-layout of the tech tree to highlight synergistic upgrades for drones[/b]
[b]Continuous Tread Leg [/b]
- Zippy speeds! Only for droids who do field work and never need to go near combat...
- Recommended for T1's
[b]Mechanical Production Chains[/b]
- Product Refinement Table for handling recipes
- Metallic textiles from Steel and Plasteel 
- Synthread production
- Mechanite harvesting for ways to eventually produce Luciferium and Hyperweave...

[b]Future Content:[/b]
Unfortunately, at this time I am planning to move across to the Mechanical Humanlikes framework where all future expansions to the core ATR mods will be occurring. This means that this mod will likely remain static now, and not receive future content updates.
This has everything I could put in it with my current skill level at the time of this most recent update (May 2023), so I'm fairly satisfied that it's a strong standalone product.

As new content gets added to the future version for Mechanical Humanlikes, if someone would like to help with porting content back into this one as well, I'm more than happy to work with them. This will remain a live branch on the Github repository.

[*]Works best with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933248825]ATR Frames Reforged[/url]!
[*]Works best with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2962634958]ATR MUFF Reforged[/url]!
[*]Built-in synergistic integration with VGP Garden Fabrics

[h1]Compatibility:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Incompatible with [sd] Luciferium Production (Continued) (and the original)
[/list]

[u]The following mods are special cases:[/u]
*EdB Prepare Carefully eventually breaks all custom pawns; but that's their problem.
*Combat Extended does their own compatibility patches; this [i]should[/i] be fine if they're patched for ATR.

[b]Will this work with other older Android Tiers mods?[/b]
[i]No, ATR uses specific ATR tagged versions of things, which it calls upon to work.[/i]

[b]Can this be patched to work with other versions of Android Tiers?[/b]
[i]If you make a patch, I'll happily add it in. I have no intention of patching it myself though.[/i]

[b]Will you add the other localisations for other languages like ATR has?[/b]
[i]As above, if you would like to provide a localisation, I'll happily add it in.[/i]
