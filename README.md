# ATR-Industrial-Automatons (Frames Reforged)
Designed for Rimworld 1.4

The main ATR maintains the noble and wise goal of balancing content and choice with gameplay experience.
Where there is room for more niche items not suitable to the design philosophy of the core mod, this mod is part of a set intended to enable those options for determined players.

This mod reworks and expands upon features designed to be used with T1 and other biomimetic drones. It is intended to be used with the Android Tiers Reforged mod.

## Features
* Complete re-layout of the tech tree to highlight synergistic upgrades for drones
* Continuous Tread Leg
  - Zippy speeds! Only for droids who do field work and never need to go near combat...
  - Recommended for T1's

Future Fun:
* Recharge Throne
  - A chair for unfeeling cooks to charge and cook at the same time! (Hideously uncomfortable...)
* Clankity Joints
  - Replacement joints with their own processors.
  - Will cause droids to automatically adopt rakish spacecowboy poses and lounge indolently on couches.
  - Mildly amusing for your other pawns. Warning; may make T1's appear to have personality.

Other Future Planned Stuff:
* Spacer tech production mimetics
* Android work gear
* More legs, arms, etc.

I am happy to incorporate other ideas if people have them.

## Recommended:
* Works best with ATR Frames Reforged!

## Compatibility:
* Requires Android Tiers Reforged
* Safe to add to a save game, may have some oddness with the tech tree but won't break anything.
* No known incompatibilities - it'll just do nothing without ATR.

## Questions
> **Will this work with other older Android Tiers mods?**

No, ATR uses specific ATR tagged versions of things, which it calls upon to work.

> **Can this be patched to work with other versions of Android Tiers?**

If you make a patch, I'll happily add it in. I have no intention of patching it myself though.

> **Will you add the other localisations for other languages like ATR has?**

As above, if you would like to provide a localisation, I'll happily add it in.
