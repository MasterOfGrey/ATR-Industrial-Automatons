        <label>Continuous tread leg</label>
        <description>A leg built with a continuous track of treads driven by multiple small wheels, instead of a foot. It is ugly, vulnerable in combat, and slightly increases power requirements, as well as making it difficult to hold a stable position for more precise tasks, but it provides a significant movement speed bonus. Ideal for units that don't care about the drawbacks.</description>
